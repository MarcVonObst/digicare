for the static html files to be able to access the rest api, they have to have the same origin, so that the calls are not
blocked by the server or the browser.

We achieve this by letting both be served by apache mod-proxy, which redirects calls to one server to an other one


  sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-proxy-html
  sudo a2enmod proxy proxy_html proxy_http


in the file  /etc/apache2/mods-available/proxy.conf
put:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
<IfModule mod_proxy.c>
[...]
	ProxyPass /api http://localhost:12345
	ProxyPassReverse /api http://localhost:12345

	ProxyPass /app http://localhost:8000/app
	ProxyPassReverse /app http://localhost:8000/app

        <Proxy *>
                AddDefaultCharset off
                Order deny,allow
			  		 Deny from all
                Allow from all
        </Proxy>
[...]

</IfModule>

------------------------------------------------


then restart apache
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart


now apache points /api to localhost, port 12345, which is the port restlet runs on
and /app to 8000, which is the port the node.js server from angular runs on. 
the app directory with the static htmls could also be served by apache, then we would not need
a rewrite for that url.
